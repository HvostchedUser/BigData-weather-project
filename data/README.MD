# Dataset and its derivatives

## Dataset information

[Weather Dataset | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muthuj7/weather-dataset)

It is a dataset containing the information about weather in Leeds, England

There are 12 columns and 96453 rows containing information such as date and time, wind power, amount of clouds, temperature, humidity and so on.

## Goal

This work aims to generate predictions of how clear the sky is ["Summary" column] based on the provided information.

## Rationale for choosing this dataset

* Lack of cloud detection radars in the presence of simple weather stations, the lack of data could be replenished

* Providing the weather service userbase with useful, concise information based on available data
